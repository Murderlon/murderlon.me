## Noticeable things  ✨
- CSS grid layout
- Modular typography based on the perfect fifth (2:3)
- Canvas animations (ugh, SVG probably would have been better)
- Thoroughly accessible (I think, gave it a good try at least)
- Critical CSS
- Asset preloading with fallback
- Server-side compression with Gzip
- Server-side email handling
- No Gulp or Webpack, just npm scripts.

## To do 🛠
- CSS grid fallback
- HTTPS/2 server push
- Picture element with webp images
- Find a HTML/image watcher.
